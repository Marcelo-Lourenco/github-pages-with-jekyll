# GitHub Pages

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) are public web pages for users, organizations, and repositories, that are freely hosted on GitHub’s ``github.io`` domain or on a custom domain name of your choice. GitHub Pages are powered by Jekyll behind the scenes, so they’re a great way to host your Jekyll-powered website for free.

Your site is automatically generated by GitHub Pages when you push your source files. Note that GitHub Pages works equally well for regular HTML content, simply because Jekyll treats files without front matter as static assets. So if you only need to push generated HTML, you’re good to go without any further setup.

The [GitHub Pages Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages) is comprehensive and includes a [guide to setting up a GitHub Pages site using Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/). We recommend following this guide.

This page contains some additional information which may be useful when working on GitHub Pages sites with Jekyll.
